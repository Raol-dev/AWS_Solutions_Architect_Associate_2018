Kinesis --

* Streaming data is data generated continously by several data sources in small sizes typically.
  Eg:- Purchases online, stock prices, game data, social network data, Uber data, etc.
* Kinesis lets you send that data and analyze it.

Kinesis Services --

* Kinesis Streams
* Kinesis Firehose
* Kinesis Analytics

Kinesis Streams --

* Basically stores data for 24 hrs by default. Can increase to 7 days.
* Stored in shards. A fleet of EC2 instances take them and convert them into meaningful data. Then store them in DynamoDB, S3, Redshift etc.
* Shard --
  * 5 transactions per second for reads, max of total data read rate of 2Mb per sec and upto 1000 records per second for writes, max write rate of 1Mb per sec.
* Data capacity of the stream is the no of shards specified for the stream.

Kinesis Firehose --

* No shards or about handling it.
* It's automated. Using Lambda is analyzed in realtime.
* No retention. Directly analyzed or stored into S3 or Redshift ,etc.


Kinesis Analytics --

* Allows to run SQL queries on the data stored in Kinesis Streams or Firehose and store in ELasticSearch or S3 or Redshift.
