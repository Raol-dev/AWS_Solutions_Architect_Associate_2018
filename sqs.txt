Q) You run a website which hosts videos and you have two types of members, premium fee paying members and free members. All videos uploaded by both your premium members and free members are processed by a fleet of EC2 instances which will poll SQS as videos are uploaded. However you need to ensure that your premium fee paying members videos have a higher priority than your free members. How do you design SQS?


SQS allows you to set priorities on individual items within the queue, so simply set the fee paying members at a higher priority than your free members.


A -- Create 2 SQS one for premium and another for free members. EC2 should poll premium one first and only if it is empty the free ones.
