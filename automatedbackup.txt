Automated Backups --

* It allows you to take daily snapshots up until 35 days. Default is for 7 days.
* Automated Backup is allowed by default. 
* It'sstored in S3. Free storage worth the size of RDs is given. 10 GB RDS instance will give you 10GB in S3.
* Latency can be experienced while backup is going on. Choose proper backup window.

* DB snapshots are done manually. They are stored even after RDS instance has been deleted, unlike automated backups. 
* Restoring automated backup or snapshot will result in new instance.

* Encryption is supported for SQL DBs. It is done using AWS KMS. This results in data stored at rest being encrypted as are backups, read replicas and snapshots.
* Encrypting an existing DB instance is not supported.

* To encrypt entirely new DB is to be created.

* Can restore DB to an automated backup or full snapshot or point in time of a snapshot.
* Cannot encrypt using restoring unencrypted snapshot.

* Multi AZ allows you to have an exact copy in another AZ.
* This helps for maintenance.
* Used for disaster  recovery. Not for performance for which read replica is the one to use.

Read Replica --

* Uses asynchronous replication and creates exact copy from where read operation can work unlike in multi AZ.
* Read replica of read replica is allowed. Upto 5 read replicas is allowed.
* For test or dev purpose it can be done. It is used by changing connection strings in EC2 instances.

* Supported DB types --
  * MySQL
  * Postgre SQL
  * MariaDB

TIPS --

* Read replica for scaling not for disaster recovery.
* Multi AZ for disaster recovery.
* For read intensive applications, use Read replica or Elasticache.
* Read replicas need automatic backups setup.
* More read replicas of read replicas increases latency.
* Each read replica has it's own DNS endpoint.
* Read replcas cannot have multi AZ.
* Read replica can be turned on for multi AZ turned on DB.

* Read replicas can be turned on to be their own databases. This breaks the replication. This is done if you want to write to it. 
* Read replicas can't be written into.
