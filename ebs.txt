EBS Volumes --

* EBS as noted before is like a hard disk in a computer and hence it's not possible to have EBS volumes in a different AZ as compared to an EC2 instance.

* Can modify volume on the go withput downtime if it's SSD or IO1 but not for standard magnetic storage.

* Inorder to move EBS volumes from one AZ to another we need to create snapshot of it first. A new volume can be created out of the snapshot. Same applies to moving across a region.
* Out of a snapshot it can be used as a root volume.

* Snapshots include incremental changes only. Not the whole changes , i.e. not a copy.
* AMI's can be created out of snapshots or volumes.
* EBS volume size nad storage type can be changed on the go.

* Volumes will ALWAYS be in the same availability zone as the EC2 instance.
* Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically.
* Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically.
* Snapshots can be shared only if they are not encrypted. They can be made public or shared with other AWS accounts.


Windows Instance, RAID, Volumes & Snapshots --

RAID = Redundant Array of Independent Disks

RAID 0 - Striped, No Redundancy, Good Performance.
RAID 1 - Mirrored, Redundancy
RAID 5 - Good for reads, bad for write. Checksum is used to replicate on all disks. AWS does not recommend it.
RAID 10 - Striped, Mirrored, Good Redundancy, Good performance.

* Cassandra like DB which is not supported in AWS can be done using RAID to support additional IO.

* Snapshot in a RAID array is tricky.

* We need to take application consistent snapshot. This is due to cache data not included in snapshot which is fine in single volumes.
  * Freeze file system.
  * Unmount RAID Array
  * Shutting down associated EC2 instance.

ENcryption --

* Amazon EBS encryption uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master keys (CMKs) when creating encrypted volumes and any snapshots created from them. A unique AWS-managed CMK is created for you automatically in each region where you store AWS assets. This key is used for Amazon EBS encryption unless you specify a customer-managed CMK that you created separately using AWS KMS.
