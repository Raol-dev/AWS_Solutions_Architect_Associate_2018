VPC -- IMPORTANT

* Virtual Data Center
* Every region has default VPC.
* AWS defines VPC as isolated section of AWS Cloud where you launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your networking
  environment in that you can choose IP addresses, creation of subnets and configuration of route tables and network gateways.
  
  
* One subnet = one AZ -- IMPORTANT

* Address ranges supported by AWS for private subnet --
  10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 - 10/8 prefix -- most addresses
  172.16.0.0 - 172.16.255.255 - 173.16/12 -- less than first one
  192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 - 192.168/16 -- least addresses
  
  Max netmask is 28 -- which gives 16 addresses. 10.0.0.0/28  -- Range -> 10.0.0.1 - 10.0.0.14
  
  
* 5 VPCs in a region. Soft limit can be raised by contacting AWS support team.

* Each subnet goes into separate AZs and addresses can then be assigned to them.

What can be done with a VPC --

* Launch instances into a subnet of your choosing.
* Assign custom IP address ranges in each subnet.
* Configure route tables b/w subnets. This would let you block two subnets from communicating with each other if required.
* Create internet gateway and attach it to our VPC. ONLY 1 internet Gateway per VPC.
* Better security.
* Instance security groups. Security groups can span AZs and be shared as well.
* Subnet ACLs. Block IP addresses if necessary.

Default VPC v/s Custom VPC --

* Default VPC is user friendly and it's created by AWS in every single region when you create an account.
* Default VPC has internet gateway enabled. No private subnets by default. Have to create if necessary.
* If deployed into default VPC, each EC2 instance will have private and public IPs.

VPC Peering --

* Allows you to connect VPCs using a direct network route using private IP addresses.
* Instances behave as if they are in the same network.
* VPC Peering can be done with VPCs in same account or different AWS account.
* VPC is in Star Configuration. Hub and Spoke model. 1 central VPC with multiple Peers. 
  No transitive peering. Means VPC A connected to VPC B and VPC C won't let VPC C and VPC B communicate. For that VPC C and VPC B need to have direct peering.
  
* Security Groups are STATEFUL but Network Access Lists are NOT.
  If port 80 is opened in security group, then inbound and outbound also it's opened. But in Network Access List that's to be done separaately for inbound and outbound.
