AMI can be selected based on --

* Region
* OS
* Arch
* Launch permissions
* Storage for Root Device (Root Device Volume)
  * Instance Store (EPHEMERAL STORAGE) -- Less durability. If health is down you lose memory. Takes longer to provision.
  * EBS Backed Volumes -- If health is degraded, reboot the instance and new virtualization is used.
  
  
  * Instance store volumes cannot be stopped. If underlying host fails, data is lost.
  * EBS backed volumes can be stopped. Data is not lost if it is stopped.
  * By default, ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination for EBS volumes, but this can be changed.
