VPC Flow Logs --

* VPC Flow Logs let you capture info about IP data flowing in and out of VPCinterfaces.
* It is stored using Amazon CloudWatch logs.

* Network Interface level

TIPS --

* Cannot enable FLow logs for VPCs peered with your VPC unless the peer VPC is in your account.
* Cannot tag a flow log.
* Can't change IAM once a flow log has been created.
* Not all IP traffic is monitored :
  * Traffic to Amazon DNS is not. Custom DNS is logged if it's used.
  * Traffic for Windows instance to generate Amazon WIndows license.
  * Traffic to and from 169.254.169.254 for instance metadata.
  * DHCP traffic.
  * Traffic to reserved IP address for the default VPC router.
