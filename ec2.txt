EC2 --

* On Demand -- By the hour (by the second for linux only).
* RI -- Upfront payment and capacity reservation.
* Spot -- Bid for instance capacity.
* Dedicated Hosts -- Physical EC2 hardware.

Reserved --

* Steady or predictable usage.
* Upfront payment gives discount.
  * Standard RI -- Upto 75% off on demand.
  * Convertible RIs -- Can convert from Linux RI to WIndows RI. Upto 54% off on demand
  * Scheduled RIs
  
Spot --

* Flexible start and end times
* Applications feasible at very low compute prices.
* Users who need urgent capacity for large computing.

Dedicated Hosts --

* Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization.
* Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments.
* Can be purchased On-Demand.
* Can be purchased as RI also.

EC2 Instance Types --

* D2 - Density -- Hadoop,warehousing 
* R4 - Memory Optimized.  --> RAM  -- DBs
* M4 - General purpose -- App Servers
* C4 - Compute Optimized -- CPU intensive Apps/DBs
* G2 - Graphics intensive -- 3D App Streaming, Video Encoding
* I2 -- High speed storage -- NoSQL DBs, Data Warehousing
* F1 -- FPGA -- H/w acceleration for code
* T2 -- Lowest cost, General Purpose -- Web Servers/Small DBs
* P2 -- Graphics/General Purpose GPU -- Machine Learning, Bitcoin mining
* X1 -- Xtreme memory -- SAP HANA/Apache Spark


Pricing --

* By the second for linux instances but by the hour for Windows instances.


IMPORTANT --
DIRTMCGFPX or DR Mc GIFT PX

D - Density
R - RAM
M - main choice for general purpose apps
C - Compute
G - Graphics
I - IOPS
F - FPGA -- H/w optimization
T - cheap general purpose T2 micro
P - Graphics (think pics)
X - Extreme Memory


EBS Volumes Types --

* General Purpose SSD (GP2)
  * balance price and performance.
  * 3 IOPS per GB with upto 10000 IOPS and ability to burst upto 3000 IOPS for volumes at 3334GiB and above.
* Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)
  * Designed for I/O intensive apps such as NoSQl or large relationl databases.
  * Used if IOPS requiredis more than 10000 IOPS.
  * Upto 20000 IOPS per Volume.
* Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1) -- Magnetic storage type
  * Big databases
  * Data warehouses
  * Log processing
  * Cannot be a boot volume
* Cold HDD (SC1) -- Magnetic storage type
  * Lowest cost storage for infrequently used workloads.
  * File server.
  * Cannot be boot server.
* magnetic (Standard)
  * Lowest cost per gigabyte of all EBS volume types that is bootable. Magnetic volumes is ideal for infrequently accessed data and for low storage cost.
  * Bootable.
  
* Can't mount one EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances, instead use EFS. EBS is more like internal hard disk.
* One subet equals one availability zone.


* Volume attached to EC2 is deleted on termination by default.
* Termination Protection is turned off by default.
